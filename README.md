# Annes Armory

Annes Armory is a full re-balance of vanilla equipment progression, intended to increase the usefulness period of low-tier equipment such as stone and leather gear, revitalize older systems such as Anvil repair, and to incentivise early-game engagement with systems such as enchanting.

## Gear Upgrading

Starting with Iron Tier, gear can no longer be directly crafted. Iron and Diamond gear must now be created using the template system, similar to Netherite.

Iron upgrade templates can be found in villages, and basic spawner-dungeons. Diamond upgrade templates can be found in Ancient Cities, as well as rarely appearing in Trial Chambers and Nether Fortresses.

## Anvil and Tool Repair Tweaks

Anvils have been completely reworked. Fully repairing an item now always only costs one repair material and one level. Applying enchanted books with an anvil now costs an XP amount depending on the total final enchantment level of the tool, instead of depending on how many times the tool has previously been in an anvil.

## Repair Kits

Repair Kits have been added as a way to repair items on the go. They cost no XP to use, but are less efficient, only repairing a third of the tools max damage per repair material used.

## Tool Variants (Upcoming)

Tool variants are created with smiting templates found as rare loot in the world. They completely change the way the tool is used. **This feature is planned for future updates of the mod.**
